# Introduction

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful input variables (features) that improve the performance and accuracy of predictive models. In the context of forecasting the number of foreign tourists visiting five selected countries, feature engineering helps reveal important patterns, seasonality, trends, and external factors that influence tourism flows.

# Key Aspects of Feature Engineering for Tourism Forecasting

## 1. Creating Time-Based Features

Tourism data is strongly seasonal. Time features help models learn recurring patterns. Examples include:

-   Month, Quarter, Year

-   Day of the week (useful for high-frequency data)

-   Season indicators (e.g., summer/winter tourism peaks)

-   Holiday periods, such as Christmas or national holidays

## 2. Lag Features

These capture how the number of tourists in previous periods influences future values. Examples:

-   Tourists lagged by 1 month

-   Lag 3, lag 6, lag 12 (to capture annual seasonality)

## 3. Rolling Window Statistics

Rolling features smooth fluctuations and describe recent trends. Examples:

-   3-month moving average

-   12-month rolling sum (useful for year-over-year analysis)

-   Rolling standard deviation (volatility of tourism flows)

## 4. Pandemic / Shock Indicators

Tourism is highly sensitive to global shocks. Examples:

-   COVID-19 lockdown periods

-   Political instability indicators

-   Natural disaster events

## 5. Interaction Features

Interactions help models understand combined effects, such as: “Summer season” × “Low exchange rate”.

# Why do we design features?

Well-designed features help:

-   identify seasonal tourism peaks,

-   capture long-term trends,

-   incorporate economic and social factors that influence travel decisions,

-   improve the accuracy of predictive models.

Ultimately, feature engineering enables the model to better understand what drives the number of foreign tourists in each of the five selected countries and to produce more reliable forecasts.
